     Dear Mr. Asad Khan,
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     Thanks to be part of the "International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons(ICAN)". We are a global movement <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; working to end the scourge of nuclear weapons. 
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
     Winning the Nobel Prize in 2017 gave us powerful momentum to work together and make sure every nation signs <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, including your own. 
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     We are working non-stop by getting more countries on board and strenthening the stigma around these Weapons of <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mass destruction.
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     And we're glad to have you onboard to make that happen. 
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     We will help you discover how you can get involved in our community. The end of Nuclear will come through <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; actions at all levels: International, National and Local. Your voice will be heard and it is needed in the coming months.
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
